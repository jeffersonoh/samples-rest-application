What is it?
-----------

The `sample-spring-jboss` quickstart is an example of a Java EE 6 application using JSP, JPA 2.0 and Spring 4.x. It 
includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java:

* In `jboss-as-spring-mvc-context.xml` `<context:component-scan base-package="br.com.sample.spring.controller"/>` 
and `<mvc:annotation-driven/>` are used to register both the non-rest and rest controllers.

* The controllers map the respective urls to methods using `@RequestMapping(url)`.

* To return JSON, the rest controller uses `@ResponseBody`.

* The datasource and entitymanager are retrieved via JNDI.


System Requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 6.1 or 
later with the Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit (WFK) 2.7.

To run the quickstart with the provided build script, you need the following:

1. Java 1.6, to run JBoss and Maven. You can choose from the following:
    * OpenJDK
    * Oracle Java SE
    * Oracle JRockit

2. Maven 3.0.0 or later, to build and deploy the examples
    * If you have not yet installed Maven, see the [Maven Getting Started Guide](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html) for details.
    * If you have installed Maven, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:

            mvn --version 

3. The JBoss EAP distribution ZIP.
    * For information on how to install and run JBoss, refer to the product documentation.


Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](../README.md#configure-maven) before testing the quickstarts.


Start the JBoss EAP Server
-------------------------

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server:

        For Linux:   EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\standalone.bat

 
Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include 
Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the Quickstarts](../README.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) 
for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean install jboss-as:deploy

4. This will deploy `target/sample-spring-jboss.war` to the running instance of the server.
